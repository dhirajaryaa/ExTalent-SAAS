    "portfolio": ""
  },
  "summary": "",

  },
  "experience": [
    {
      "job_title": "",
      "company": "",
      "location": "",
      "start_date": "",
      "end_date": "",

  ],

      "institution": "",

    {
      "name": "",
      "issuer": "",
      "date": ""
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Extract only what is present in the resume text, donâ€™t hallucinate.
- Dates should be normalized as YYYY-MM.
- Skills must be categorized correctly (programming languages, tools, soft skills) with score [min-0,max-100].
- Keep arrays empty if no data is found.
- links extract username, if username given so generate related site url
- Preserve exact phrasing for responsibilities and achievements.
